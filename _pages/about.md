# Greeting
Welcome, and thank you for visiting my page.

I am working as a project researcher at the International Research Center for Neurointelligence (IRCN) at the University of Tokyo.

My research focuses on computational modeling of multiple interacting systems within the human body. I develop multi-system models of the cardiovascular system (CVS), respiratory system (RS), and autonomic nervous system (ANS) to reproduce and analyze quantifiable interoceptive signals—such as variabilities of blood pressure and heart rate—validated against real human data. I am particularly interested in how cross-system interactions contribute to maintaining and mediating homeostasis and allostasis in human body.

My current work seeks to address the following fundamental questions: 
- How do quantifiable interoceptive signals, like blood pressure and heart rate, differ across neurodivergent conditions?
- How to offer self-regulation strategies for neurodivergent populations experiencing ANS dysfunction?

In addition, I am enthusiastic about integrating emerging methodologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computation—into my research to further explore the inner and inter-system dynamics of the biological body.

If you share similar interests or are curious about potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I’m always open to new ideas and interdisciplinary work.

## Projects
- *Apr 2026-Mar 2027*: CREST Young Researcher’s Challenge Project. Project Title: "*Computational Modeling of Autonomic Regulation Underlying Interoceptive Dynamics*"

  This study aims to elucidate autonomic regulation mechanisms underlying interoceptive signals such as heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) through computational modeling, comparing patterns of typically developing (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals under external stimuli. By integrating cardiovascular system (CVS), respiratory system (RS), and autonomic nervous system (ANS), this study defines autonomic control modes and relative activities of ANS branches, revealing individual diversity in physiological regulation. The study also plan to examines how ANS variations influence the link between interoceptive signals and cognitive states, and explores model-based self-regulation strategies, such as rhythmic breathing, for improving ASD individuals’ abnormal interoceptive signals and related emotional/cognitive control. While independent from the CREST main project “Cognitive Feelings that Mediate Between Perception and Emotion,” it complements it by providing physiological foundations and quantitative indices, extending the understanding of internal state prediction and regulation.
- *Jul 2024-Mar 2026*: JSPS Start-up Project. Project Title: "*Multi-system modeling method revealing interaction among interoception, and emotional states*"

  Interoception exhibits a complex interaction mechanism with emotional states. Abnormal variations of some interoceptive rhythms such as heart rate variability, blood pressure, respiratory changes, etc., manifest strong correlations with both short-term alerting stimuli and long-term mental perturbation. This project aims to establish a comprehensive analytical framework of multi-system physiological modeling Modulation of the autonomic nervous system on interoceptive rhythms will be established with consideration of emotional impacts, to unveil the relationship between physiological processes and emotions. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify appropriate self-regulation methods for restoring abnormal interoceptive rhythms affected by emotional fluctuations, thereby aiding individuals in better managing their emotional states.
